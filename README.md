Health Assistant 

Our health assistant is designed to help patients by first collecting their personal information, including name, phone number, age, and gender. Based on the patient's symptoms, disease, and medical history (such as allergies), the assistant provides appropriate medicine recommendations along with dosage instructions. This ensures that patients receive safe and suitable medication until they can consult a doctor if needed.
